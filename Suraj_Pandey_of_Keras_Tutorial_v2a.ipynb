        "* Keras was developed to enable deep learning engineers to build and experiment with different models very quickly. \n",
        "* Just as TensorFlow is a higher-level framework than Python, Keras is an even higher-level framework and provides additional abstractions. \n",
        "* Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to finding good models. \n",
        "* However, Keras is more restrictive than the lower-level frameworks, so there are some very complex models that you would still implement in TensorFlow rather than in Keras. \n",
        "* That being said, Keras will work fine for many common models. "

        "- Use MAXPOOL after such blocks.  It will help you lower the dimension in height and width.\n",

Normally, you'll want separate dev and test sets.  The dev set is used for parameter tuning, and the test set is used once to estimate the model's performance in production."
